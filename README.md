Project idea: It consists in a guessing game. A binary number from 1 to 7 is randomly generated on 3 leds and the player need to press a button in order to guess the number as a zecimal number as a position in the array of 7 leds placed together in line which will be represented as a randomly led lit on. If the player guesses the right position a green light lights on, the red light lights on otherwise. As the player guesses more consecutive positions, the speed increases.

The project as well as the web page, video and schematics are on the second branch.
